	<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;font-family:sans-serif;text-align:center;">Welcome to the best tech repair service in the Chicagoland area&#33;</h2>
	<p>
		Stopped at their store few days ago with a question about a cracked screen, ended up getting it replaced in an hour at a great price! Best service ever. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

		I rely on my computer to do my job. Without my computer I do not work.  For one who is self-employed, computer repairs are always urgent and getting back up ASAP is always critical. CTR is a life-saver.  I can rely on them to do what is needed, to not pad their bill with unnecessary charges (which they could easily do because who really gets how a computer works?), to have my PC ready when they say it will be ready and to have the charges be what they say they will be.  When I have repairs that are needed but not critical, they work within my client driven schedule to do the work when it fits my timetable.  My last repair was a fan replacement.  They even let me bring my computer in, diagnose the problem, take it back while they waited for the part to arrive, and then bring it in at my convenience for installation. Stop looking for computer service.  Just go to CTR; you will not be disappointed.

		My computer would not turn on and geek squad could not figure it out, I came to these guys and they fixed it in 24hrs. Now I can go back to wasting time on facebook.

		So far, so good. Dropped my Macbook a few days ago. Within a few hours, received an email with the issue (dead battery) and an estimate to have it fixed. Picked up the machine yesterday and it works as good as new. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Plus the 30 day warranty is an added perk in case there are any future problems. Check them out!

		I called this company because my laptop needed repair and described the problem over the phone.  It was a power supply/electrical issue and they gave me a phone estimate of $99.  When I brought the laptop in, they checked it out, told me the laptop was fine and it just had a faulty power cord which they replaced for less than $32.  The guy who waited on me was very helpful and explained some things and answered all my questions.  I was very happy to find an honest shop that didn't rip me off for some unnecessary repair and will certainly use them again.

		I was playing candy crush and got so mad I threw my tablet at the wall and the screen cracked. I didn’t have time to go anywhere to drop it off, so I used the mail in service. It wasn’t the cheapest but the turnaround time was great. 10/10 would use again. I’M NEVER THROWING MY TABLET AGAIN.
